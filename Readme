Create a database to manage Grocery store data using MYSQL workbench .

Hi everyone! I have created a database in MySQL workbench. The steps that I took in this project are as follows:

Analyzing data issues
Dividing data into categories
Creating a new database model
Adding the necessary tables
Creating an EER (Extended Entity-Relationship) Diagram
Database Testing With the creation of this database, I learned how to address the data issues that existed previously. Some of the advantages of creating a database are:
Data is easier to understand because it is categorized
Redundancy of data is eliminated, simplifying data collection.
Collected data follows a consistent format.
Inconsistent data input is avoided.
Data can be easily integrated as needed.
